protoc and protogen-go\nCreate a .proto file with a structure definition, this is called defining a message type\nUse the protoc compiler to generate a *.pb.go file (which is the golang source code that contains all your functionality related to your message type)\nInstances of a message type are called messages: msg := pb.ExampleType{}\nSet data like this: msg := pb.ExampleType{FieldName : &lt;data&gt;}\nAdd/update data like this: msg.FieldName = &lt;data&gt;\nDebug printing is done with: proto.Message(&amp;msg)\nSerialize your message: proto.Marshal(&amp;msg)\nPublish to Kafka topic: Kafka.Message{… Value: serialized_message ….})\nKafka subscriber receives this Kafka message, deserializes the data via: proto.Unmarshal(kafkaMessage.Value, &amp;msg))\nAccess fields like this: &amp;msg.GetFieldName()\nbingo bongo that's it\n\n\n💡 Note that I'm using Confluent's implementation of a Golang client for Kafka if it matters!! \n\nAbout protobuf\n\nProtocol Buffers are a mechanism for serializing structured data.\nProtobuf is short for protocol buffers\nProtobufs are like XML but way smaller.\nThey are extensible, when you start using them it's really easy to maintain backwards compatibility as you change things.\nYou can use protobuf instead of sending JSON between microservices, or when you want to send structured data in your Kafka messages. It's a bit of a time investment initially, but it's worth it for typed messages.\n\nProbably unnecessary but interesting details\n\nProtobufs are an example of an IDL, an Interface Definition Language.\nIDLs are a way for two programs written in different languages to communicate with each other.\nWhat's the difference between IDL and API? An IDL is a language that can describe APIs, in a platform independent way.\nAvro is an IDL that uses JSON if that's more your jam.\nProtobufs were started in Google and are used in Google's internal communication between services. \nGoogle uses an RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect their zillions of servers. Stubby is google specific, but gRPC is a generalized open-source RPC framework based on Stubby (and uses protobuf as default). If you see RPC/gRPC pop up a lot while researching protobufs, this is why.\nRPCs are much beyond the scope of this doc, but basically a way for machines to communicate with one another and execute procedures, and the calling and execution of procedures doesn't have to be in the same address space (a call one one machine can be executed on another machine in the same network). Great for highly distributed systems.\nProtobufs aren't compressed by default, but you can compress them with zip, gzip etc.\nSometimes compression is sub-optimal for data in the form of JPEGs and PNGs, where JPEG/PNG compression will do a better job.\nWhen protobuf messages are serialized, the same data can have different binary representations, so you can't check for equality on serialized data.\nMarshalling is similar or synonymous to serialization, although there may be a slight difference between the two depending on the language or framework. \n\nProtoc Setup\nGo isn't actually one of the languages the protobuf compiler (protoc) supports by default, so you have to download a Go plugin, called protogen-go. There are two versions available, the github.com one is depreciated, so use the google.com one. We'll talk about this more later.\ngo install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest\n\nDownloading protoc\nGo to this web page: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/ and look at the list of latest releases. Download the compressed file that applies to you. I am using Go and Ubuntu, so I downloaded protoc-3.19.4-linux-x86_64.zip, since as of now, 3.18.4 is the latest version.\nOnce you download it, unzip into a directory called protoc (that's what the -d flag is doing). But this is just for you, you can put this anywhere and name it anything.\nunzip -d protoc/ protoc-3.19.4-linux-x86_64.zip\n\nAfter unzipping, your protoc directory should look like this:\n.\n├── bin\n│   └── protoc\n├── include\n│   └── google\n│       └── protobuf\n│           ├── .....\n└── readme.txt\n\nAs advised by the readme.txt, copy the content of the include directory to /usr/local/include and the protoc binary to somewhere like /usr/bin.\nsudo cp -r include/google /usr/local/include\nsudo cp bin/protoc /usr/bin\n\nThe compiler, protoc, takes a *.proto file with protocol buffer definition in it and then generates the source code that you use with your applications code. I had a lot of problems with setting up protoc, all path related and really annoying and boring. So I instead did a quick hack, to get up and running quickly.\nIf you have protoc working, skip the next section.\nResolving my protoc issues in kind of a gross way\nI tried a slew of things, but I continued to have issues with protoc and paths to things. Since I have better things to do, I did this just to get up and running quickly. I have since changed things on my machine which maybe means I don't have to go this route anymore, but honestly who cares. This way I never have to care about my paths and all my *.proto files are together, and it's easy to move them where they need to be.\n\nI created a directory (/protobuf-generator) where all my other Go repos live (I don't use ~/go because I like making life harder for myself) \nand to that I added /github.com (from github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf, just for the example directory from the official tutorial),\nthen I added /google (from google.golang.org/protobuf/protec-gen-go, the actual plugin),\nand finally protoc, which is the compiler's executable binary.\n\nHere's what all that looks like:\n.\n├── go-application\n│   ├── go.mod\n│   ├── go.sum\n│   ├── main.go\n│   └── proto-definitions\n│       └── example.pb.go\n└── protobuf-generator\n    ├── example.pb.go\n    ├── example.proto\n    ├── github.com\n    │   └── ......\n    ├── google\n    │   └── protobuf\n    │       ├── ....\n    └── protoc\n\nSo I create my protobuf generated classes directly in protobuf-generator, and then slap them into go-application/proto-definitions. I actually wrote a little bash script to make feel cleaner and to somewhat automate it. I called it something like run_protoc.sh, and it contains:\nif protoc -I ./ --go_out=./ ./example.proto; then\n\tcp example.pb.go ../go-application/proto-definitions\n\tcp example.proto ../go-application/proto-definitions # so that .proto is in your app's repo\n\techo \"Protobufs Updated!\"\nelse\n    echo \"Oopsie\"\nfi\n\nTo run it, chmod it (so it's executable) and then run like a regular script.\nchmod a+x run_protoc.sh  # do this once\n./run_protoc.sh   # do this whenever you update example.proto\n\nAnd then for example, to reference the message definitions in main.go I have:\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t.\n\t.\n\t.\n        \"github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go/kafka\"\n        \"google.golang.org/protobuf/proto\"\n        pb \"github.com/mygithub/go-application/proto-definitions\"\n    )\n\nAlso package in example.proto should be set to whatever proto-definitions is actually called. And don't make proto-definitons a module.\nAnd these are not the names I use!! Using something as generic as /proto-definitons is super frowned upon in Go, so choose something more specific and descriptive (like the name of your most relevant message definition).\nTo clarify  -- because this is a mess --  these are what the paths look like:\n~/go/src/github.com/mygithub/go-application/proto-definitions\n~/go/src/github.com/mygithub/protobuf-generator\n\nAnd don't forget to double check your Go environment variables are correct and exist (don't ask me why I didn't just have this in my .zshrc, I don't have an answer. But they are in there now).\nexport GOROOT=/usr/local/go\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/&lt;go-project-dir&gt;\nexport GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin\nexport PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT:$GOPATH:$GOBIN\n\nIf you check $GOBIN, you should have the binary of the protoc-gen-go plugin.\nSo with all this you can generate protobuf classes and use types in your message definitions provided by protobuf, like timestamp (\"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\"). And use the example/tutorial from the official protobuf/Go tutorial.\nGenerating protobufs files (*.pb.go)\nCreating *.proto files is easy and fun. The tutorial is really clear on this front. Here's an example from the official Go/protobuf tutorial, with all the essentials:\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\npackage tutorial;\nimport \"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto\";\noption go_package = \"./\";\nmessage Person {\n  string name = 1;\n  int32 id = 2;  // Unique ID number for this person.\n  string email = 3;\n  enum PhoneType {\n    MOBILE = 0;\n    HOME = 1;\n    WORK = 2;\n  }\n  message PhoneNumber {\n    string number = 1;\n    PhoneType type = 2;\n  }\n  repeated PhoneNumber phones = 4;\n  google.protobuf.Timestamp last_updated = 5;\n}\n// Our address book file is just one of these.\nmessage AddressBook {\n  repeated Person people = 1;\n}\n\noption go_package is where the generated class of (&lt;example&gt;.pb.go) will be output.\npackage will be the name of the folder where the &lt;example&gt;.pb.go file will live. If you are following what I've been doing it's proto-definitions. \nSo now to compile:\nprotoc -I ./ --go_out=./ ./example.proto\n\n\n-I is the source directory\n--go_out is telling protoc you want go code, the directory where it should go\n\nFor the most part it's really easy, but I have not needed to do anything complex with them yet. For general information on defining message types see: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial\n\n💡 for real, look at this: developers.google.com/protocol-buffers It's explained really well.\n\nAnd you're all done with setup, now you have your protobuf class ready and you can begin using protobufs within your project!\nProgramming with protobufs\nFields\nYou name your fields in snake_case and protoc will convert them to CamelCase. (This is what the style guide says to do).\nFor example: my_field becomes MyField\nAlso note that: _my_Field becomes XMyField\nNested messages are like the following:\nmessage Foo {\n\t\tmessage Bar {}\n}\n// defines two structs: Foo, Foo_Bar\n\nOneOf is pretty neat:\nmessage Profile {\n\t\toneof avatar {\n\t\t\t\tstring image_url = 1;\n\t\t\t\tbytes image_data = 2;\n\t\t}\n}\n\nDynamic length arrays:\nmessage Example {\n\t\trepeated int32 lot_of_numbers = 1;\n}\n\nEnums (defining and setting)\nDefined like this:\nmessage Convo {\n\tenum GreetingType {\n\t      HI = 0;\n\t      HELLO = 1;\n\t      HEY = 2;\n\t}\n\tGreeting my_greeting = 1; // this setting the tag, not the value\n}\n\nThe have to have one at 0, because 0 is the default and everything must have a default value. It also has to be first.\nSuppose you get some input/data from somewhere with \"HELLO\" in it, and that's what you want to set your enum field to, you can go this:\ndata := \"HELLO\"\nmsg := &amp;pb.Convo{}\nmsg.MyGreeting = pb.Convo_GreetingType(pb.convo_GreetingType_value[data])\nfmt.Printf(\"I said: %s\\n\", msg.GetMyGreeting())\n// output: I said: HELLO\n\nPrinting messages\nIf you want to see everything that's in your message then do this:\nfmt.Printf(\"My Message:  %s\\n\",  proto.Message(msg)) \n// output: My Message: MyGreeting:HELLO\n\nSerializing Messages\nmsg := &amp;pb.ExampleType{}\n// .... do some things with msg\nbuff, err := proto.Marshal(msg)\n\nDeserializing Messages\nserialized_data := // ..... \nmsg := &amp;pb.ExampleType{}\nproto.Unmarshal(serialized_data, msg)\n\nProtobufs in Kafka messages\n// .................... \n// Subscriber\nkafka_msg, err := consumer.ReadMessage()\nmy_example := &amp;pb.ExampleType{}\nproto.Unmarshal(msg.Value, my_example)\nfmt.Printf(\"\\n%s\\n\", proto.Message(my_example))\n// Publisher\nanother_example := &amp;pb.ExampleType{}\n// do stuff with another_example\nbuff, err = proto.Marshal(another_example)\nerr = producer.Produce(&amp;kafka.Message{ TopicPartition: my_partition,\n                                            Value: buff},\n                                            my_delivery_chan)\n// .....................\n\nProtobuf on the frontend\nI haven't done this yet, and it may be a while before I do. I am rewriting the backend of an app and I am going to use the corresponding frontend which expects JSON. This is actually maybe not a great idea to be honest because according to the protojson documentation, the conversion from proto.Message to JSON via protojson.Marshal is not stable, and it recommends to not rely on it. But anyhoo this is what I do:\nmsg :=  // serialized Kafka message, it contains message with ExampleType structure\n\nexample := &amp;pb.ExampleType{} \nerr = proto.Unmarshal(msg.Value, example) // deserialize my Kafka message\n\n// check for errors or something\njson_message, err = protojson.Marshal(req) // convert to json in a byte array\n\n// send json_message, which is of type []byte,  an array of bytes\n\nI think this a good resource if you would like to send back protobuf messages instead: https://techblog.livongo.com/how-to-use-grpc-and-protobuf-with-javascript-and-reactjs/\nProtobuf and databases\nThis looks pretty cool if you want to use GORM (a popular Golang ORM) to store protobuf structures in a DB: https://github.com/infobloxopen/protoc-gen-gorm\n","id":"https://jxlxx.org/posts/01-golang-and-kafka-and-protobufs/","title":"How to use Protobuf with Golang & Kafka"},"https://jxlxx.org/posts/02-getting-kafka-on-an-m1/":{"body":"Librdkafka\nconfluent-kafka requires librdkafka. brew install librdkafka didn't work for me, so I needed to clone the repo and build it.

Maybe for you... It has cost me everything.\n\nWhat is RADIUS?\nRADIUS is a network protocol.\nServers that accept and send the RADIUS protocol are called radius servers.\nEveryone who has used the internet has probably interacted with a radius server. They are commonly used by ISPs, cellular network providers, and corporate/educational networks.\nThe primary functions of RADIUS is usually referred to as AAA.\n\nAuthentication\n\nare the users/devices who they say they are?\nvalidate some credentials\n\n\nAuthorization\n\nare the users/devices allowed to use the network?\n\n\nAccounting\n\ntrack the usage of the network by users/devices\n\n\n\nFor example, Eduroam uses RADIUS servers.\nIf you’re trying to wrap your mind around OpenRoaming, just think about how Eduroam works.\nhttps://eduroam.org/how/\nhttps://wballiance.com/openroaming/how-it-works/\nHere is a quick sketch of the physical hardware is involved:\nComponentFunctionHardware\nUser/deviceRequests access to the networklaptop, phone, etc\nNetwork Access Server (NAS)Provides access to the networkRouter, Switch, Access Point, VPN Terminator, etc\nRADIUS ServerReceives authentication requests from the NAS. Returns authorization information to NAS. Recieves accounting information.freeRADIUS, diameter, Radiator, ISE\n\nAn important word to note is a NAS. A user/client/device interacts with something refered to as a NAS (Network Access Server) which is something like a router (but could be other things) and that device is what reaches out to the Radius server.\nAnother important word is realm. A realm tells radius what group/organization a user belongs to. Realms are reminisant of email addresses and are used in a somewhat similar way.\nThe format of a realm is &lt;USER-STRING&gt;@&lt;REALM&gt;.\nWhat is FreeRadius?\nThe most commonly used radius server is the freeRadius server. \nSetting up a freeRadius server consists of:\n\nediting various configuration files\nand including/excluding the right files. \n\nTo run a freeRadius server you must:\t\n\nput the config files in a file system where freeRadius is expecting them\ninstall the freeRadius software on a local machine, server, or container\nrun it\n\nHere is a simple example directory for a freeRadius configuration:\nraddb/\n    mods-available/...\n    mods-enabled/...\n    sites-available/...\n    sites-enabled/...\n    clients.conf\n    proxy.conf\n    radiusd.conf\n\nEverything lives inside of a raddb/ folder.\n\nmods-availabledirectory contains sample configurations for all of the modules.\nmods-enabledenabled modules; sometimes these are just softlinks to the equivalent file in mods-avaliable\nmods-configextra configuration for modules\nsites-availablethis contains sample \"virtual servers\". Most of these will not be used. They exist as documentation and as examples of \"best practices\".\nsites-enabledthis contains the configuration for \"virtual servers\" that are being used by the server.\n\nThe rest of the conf files allow to define how the server listens to requests and what it does with with them.\nThe radiusd.conf file contains the server configuration.\nThe proxy.conf file controls the servers behaviour towards ALL other servers to which it sends proxy requests.\nThe clients.conf file defines RADIUS clients (usually a NAS, Access Point, etc.) by specifying parts and protocols.\nIn general the syntax of the configuration files looks something like this:\n\nserver name_of_server {\n\tan_authentication_mod\n\n\thuh {\n\t\tWHAT\n\t}\n}\n\n\nBut it depends on what you are configuring exactly.\nSections\nConfiguration files are broken up into something called \"sections\" or sometimes \"blocks.\"\nthis_is_a_section {\n\n}\n\nSome important sections:\n\nserver \nclient\nsecurity\nlogging\n... etc\n\nSome important subsections with a server section:\n\nauthorize\nauthenticate\npre-accounting\naccounting\npost-accounting\nproxy\n... etc\n\nHelpful FreeRadius Documentation\n\nTechnical Guide\nGetting Started FreeRadius\n\nAuthentication\nThe radius server receives a request and decides what to do with it. It decides based on:\n\nwhat authentication types you have enabled in the server\nwhat the server can look up in a DB\nwhat’s in the request\n\nThe server starts by querying the modules in the authorize section:\n\nunix module, can you do this?\npap module, can you do this?\nmschap module can you do this?\netc.\n\nUntil there is some kind of match by one of the modules.\nA module will find a match by searching the request for key attributes, such as MS-CHAP-Challenge (for mschap) or EAP-Message (for eap), etc.\nIf the module does find a match, it sets the Auth-Type to itself.\nFor example, suppose that the user sent a request with a User-Password attribute and pap is enabled. The pap module will have set Auth-Type=pap.\nAt the end of the authorize step, the server will check if anything set the Auth-Type if not, it will immediately reject the request.\nIf anything is missing or in the wrong form?  → reject 🗑\nThe naming of the authorize section is kind of misleading. This is really more like a pre-authentication step.\nRadius servers can also proxy requests to other servers to do the actual authentication.\nNetwork Access Server\nThe NAS acts as the gateway between the user and the wider network.\nThe NAS will send the users request to access the network to the Radius server. The server will try to authenticate user give the information in the request. After that, the radius server will instruct the NAS whether to allow access to the user and how much.\nThe NAS acts as the gateway router and firewall for that user.\nThis means that the server simply returns a decision to the NAS, but it’s up to the NAS to enforce it.\nThere is nothing the radius server can do to make the NAS behave as intended.\t\nThe radius server receives a request and decides what to do with it. Its decision is based on:\n\nwhat authentication types you have enabled in the server\nwhat the server can look up in a DB\nwhat’s in the request\n\nThe server cannot request additional information from the NAS, so it has to decided what to do with the information it has. It figures out what to with via policies. A policy can be something like “accept anyone with a correct username/password combo.” Or more complicated like: “allow basic users to request premium services in non-premium hours, except for Sundays and holidays, so long as their payment status is up to date”\nRadius Dictionaries\nRadius is a binary-based protocol, not a text-based one. so when we are talking about attributes in the request, like User-Name they are actually encoded in the message as binary data. Dictionary files are used to map between the names used by people and the binary data in the RADIUS packets.\nPackets sent to/from a NAS contain: a number, length, and binary data.\nA dictionary file is a list of entries, each of which contain: a name, a number, and a data type.\nThe server uses the dictionary like this: \n\nit searches the dictionaries to match the number in the packet \nthe corresponding data type is used by the server to interpret the data type \nand the name is used in all the debug/logging messages.\n\nNote that the NAS and server may use different dictionaries, which may cause problems.\nAlso note that servers require access to a vendor dictionary to understand vendor attributes.\nradiusd.conf\nThe radiusd.conf file contains the server configuration.\nThe \"unlang\" policy language can be used to create complex if / else policies. \nThe client configuration is defined in clients.conf.\nConfiguration File Syntax\nConfiguration files are UTF-8 text.\nThey are line-orientated, meaning everything has to be on a separate line.\nA configuration item is an internal variable that has a name and holds a value.\nvariable = value\n\nVariables have data types. The can be IP addresses, strings, number, etc.\nPortions of the configuration can be grouped in sections:\ntexas {\n  dallas = yes\n  houston = no\n  san_antonio = 70\n}\n\nA configuration file can load another configuration file via the $INCLUDE statement:\n$INCLUDE other.conf\n\nOr a directories. Note that dotfiles .imadotfile.conf are ignored but editor “backup” files with tildes ~backup.conf are not. Also this is how you reuse variable definitions:\nsomedir = \"hello\"\n$INCLUDE ${somedir}/foo/bar/baz\n\nVariable references ${var_name} act as macros, and expand when the server loads.\nThis is different from run-time expansion, which is done like this: %{...}\nYou can also use environment variables:\n$ENV{variable}\n\nAnd here’s weird one for fun: \n${reference1[name].reference2}\n\nSections can have instance names:\nsection-type instance-name {\n    [ statements ]\n}\n\nFor example, the client section is used to define information about a client. When multiple clients are defined, they are distinguished by their instance-name.\nBooleans are weird in radius.\nThe boolean data type contains a true or false value. The values yes, on, and 1 evaluate to true. The values no, off, and 0 evaluate to false.\nvar = yes \n\nDelay is a data type\nDelay is a data type. It contains fractional numbers, like 1.4. These numbers are base 10. Usually they are used for timers. The resolution of delay is no more than microseconds, but usually in milliseconds.\nWords\nA word string is composed of one word, without any surrounding quotes, such as iamaword123\nStrings\nStrings can have single or double quotes, or back-ticks.\nThe main difference between the single and double quoted strings is that the double quoted strings can be dynamically expanded.\nThe syntax ${…}  is used for parse-time expansion and %{…} is used for run-time expansion.\nSome Variables\nkeywordmeaning\ncheckradCheckrad is used by the radius server to check if its idea of a user logged in on a certain port/NAS is correct if a double login is detected.\ncleanup_delayThe time to wait (in seconds) before “cleaning up” a reply that was sent to the NAS.\nhostname_lookupsDefault is no, enabled it mean DNS requests which may take super long and block other requests.\nlibdirThe libdir is where to find the rlm_* modules.\nmax_request_timeMaximum seconds to handle a request.\nmax_requestsThe maximum number of requests of which the server keeps track of.\npanic_actionWhat to do when panic. Its a string.\npidfileWhere to store the PID of the server. To make killing it easier.\n\ncleanup_delay\nThe request and replay are usually cached intenally for a short period of time after the reply is sent to the NAS. If the packets gets lost or something, the NAS might send a re-send the request. If too low, then it’s useless. If it’s too high, then the server will cache too many requests and some new requests may get blocked (see max_requests).\nSecurity Configuration\nThese directives go into a security section, like so:\nsecurity {\n\t...\n}\n\nI left out a lot but here are some interesting ones:\n\nreject_delaySeconds to wait before sending an Access-Reject. Slows down DDoS attack and slows down brute force password cracking.\nstatus_serverBoolean. Whether to respond to Status-Server requests. See also: raddb/sites-available/status\n\nThread pool\nThe thread pool is a long-lived group of threads that take turns (round-robin) handling any incoming requests.\nmax_requests_per_server\nDefault is 0.\nThe documentation says: There may be memory leaks or resource allocation problems with the server. If so, set this value to approximately 300 so that the resources will be cleaned up periodically. Not sure what the tradeoff is... do the request after 300 get dropped?\nAlso: '0' is a special value meaning 'infinity' or 'the servers never exit'.\nVirtual Servers\nA virtual server is a (nearly complete) RADIUS server.\nFreeRADIUS can run multiple virtual servers at the same time. \nVirtual servers can even proxy requests to each other.\nThe simplest way to define a virtual server would be to take all of the request processing sections from radius.conf (authorize , authenticate, etc.) and wrap them in a server {} block.\nserver foo {\n\t\tlisten {\n\t\t\tipaddr = 127.0.0.1\n\t\t\tport = 2000\n\t\t\ttype = auth\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tauthorize {\n\t\t\tupdate control {\n\t\t\t\tCleartext-Password := \"bob\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tpap\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tauthenticate {\n\t\t\tpap\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nOnly certain sub-sections can appear in a virtual server section:\n\nlisten\nclient\nauthorize\nauthenticate\nport-auth\npre-proxy\npost-proxy\npreacct\naccounting\nsession\n\nWhen a listen section is inside of a virtual server definition, it means that all requests sent to that IP/port will be processed through the virtual server. There can not be two listen sections with the same IP address and port number.\nAuthorization Section\nThe name of this section is authorize for historical reasons, as earlier versions of the server did not have a post-auth section. A more accurate description of this section would be pre-authentication.\nThe authorize section processes Access-Request packets by normalizing the request, determining\nwhich authentication method to use, and either setting the “known good” password (the valid password found in the database) for the user or informing the server that the request should be proxied.\nOnce the authorize section has finished processing the packet, the return code for the section is examined by the server. If the return code is noop, notfound, ok, or updated, then request processing continues.\nIf the return code is handled, then it is presumed that one of the modules set the contents of the reply, and the server sends the reply message. \nOtherwise, the server treats the authentication as being rejected and runs the post-auth section.\nIf the authentication has not been rejected, then the server continues processing the request by\nsearching for the Auth-Type attribute. Then the named sub-section of authenticate is executed. \nThe authorization section is starts when the server receives an Access-Request packet.\nFirst preprocesses (hints and huntgroups), then does realms, then finally the users file.\nThe order of the realm modules will determine the order in which a matching realm is found. \nauthorize {\n  filter-username\n  preprocess\n  # operator-name\n  # cui\n  # authlog\n  chap\n  mschap\n\tdigest\n\t# mimax\n\t# IPASS\n\tsuffix \n  ntdomain\n  eap {\n\t\tok = return\n  }\n  # unix\n  files\n  -sql\n  # smbpasswd\n  -ldap\n  # daily\n\texpiration\n\tlogintime\n\tpap\n\tAutz-Type Status-Server {\n  \n\t}\n}\n\nfilter-username this is a policy that sanitizing usernames in requests by removing garbage like spaces and invalid characters. If it appears invalid, the request is rejected. \nSee policy.d/filter for the definition of the filter-username policy.\npreprocess sanitizes the non-standard format attributes in the request and makes them standard.\n(I think that this mean like how a mac address can be written in like 6953 different ways)\nIf CUI is used then Operator-Name is required to be set for CUI generation.\nNot sure what this means or why it is true.\nauth_log generates a log of authentication requests.\nchap sets Auth-Type := CHAP for requests which contain a CHAP-Password attribute.\nWhen users log in with an MS-CHAP-Challenge attribute for authentication, the mschap module finds the MS-CHAP-Challenge attribute and adds Auth-Type := MS-CHAP to the request, which causes the server to then use the mschap module for authentication.\ndigestis for SIP (session initiation protocol) servers. (VoIP). who cares.\nWiMAX refers to implementations of the IEEE 802.16 family of wireless-networks standards created by the WiMAX Forum. The WiMAX specification states that the Calling-Station-Id is 6 octets of the MAC.\nThis definition conflicts with with all common RADIUS practices. Uncommenting the wimax module here means that it will fix the Calling-Station-Id attribute to the normal format. whatever.\n💡 Did you know: WiMAX was sometimes referred to as \"Wi-Fi on steroids\"[5] lol\nLooks for IPASS-style realm/ and, if not found, looks for @realm and decides whether or not to proxy based on those results.\nWhen using multiple kinds of realms, set ignore_null = yes for all of them. Otherwise, if the first style of realm doesn’t match, then the other styles won’t be checked.\nThe eap module takes care of EAP-MD5, EAP-TLS, and EAP-LEAP authentication.\nunix pulls crypt’d passwords from /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow using the system APIs to get the password.\nfiles reads the radbb/users file.\nThe -sql  module looks in an SQL database. I don’t know why it gets a dash, but -ldap gets one too, so maybe its a theme.\n... skipping a couple idc\ndaily enforces daily limits on time spent logged in. I think it requires expiration and logintime\nIf no other module has claimed responsibility for authentication, then try pap. This process allows the other modules listed above to only add a \"known good\" password to the request and nothing else. The PAP module will then see that password and use it to do PAP authentication. This module should be listed last so that the other modules get a chance to set Auth-Type for themselves.\nIf status_server = yes, then Status-Server messages are passed through the following section and only the following section.\nAutz-Type Status-Server {\n\n}\n\nAuthentication Section\nThis section lists those modules that are available for authentication. \nNote that the order of modules listed below does not mean “try each module in order”. \nInstead, a module from the authorize section adds a configuration attribute Auth-Type := FOO. That authentication type is then used to pick the appropriate module from the list below.\nThe authenticate section is only used when the server is authenticating requests locally and is\nbypassed completely when proxying.\nThis section is different from each of the other sections: it is composed of a series of subsections, only one of which is executed.\nThe Auth-Type attribute can also refer to a module (e.g. eap) instead of a subsection, in which case that module, and only that module, is processed.\nA simple example:\nauthenticate {\n\tAuth-Type PAP {\n\t\tpap\n\t}\n\tAuth-Type MS-CHAP {\n\t\tmschap\n\t}\n\tAuth-Type CHAP {\n\t\tchap\n\t}\n\teap\n}\n\nIn general, the Auth-Type attribute should not be set. The server will figure it out on its own and will do the right thing. The above is just defining Auth-Types but not actually setting the attribute.\nDo not put unlang configurations into the authenticate section. Put them in the post-auth section instead.

Most routers allow devices to connect wirelessly or through Ethernet.\nAn access point, often shortened to just AP allows devices to connect wirelessly to a Local Area Network, LAN and can also be used to extend the range of coverage to connect to a LAN (you can be physically farther away). The AP then also has a high-speed Ethernet cable runs to a router. (There is also such a thing as WAPs, wireless access points).\nA router acts as a hub for a LAN, and an AP is a sub-device in the LAN. Routers can act as APs, but not all APs can act as routers.\nA modem is a device that connects your LAN to a WAN (Wide Area Network). It is the thing that takes the digital signals that devices send to routers (binary data) and transforms it via modulation into analog data (electricity) that gets transmitted to the WAN. It also receives analog data and demodulates it, so the router can send it to the devices that asked for it. \nIt is not uncommon to see router/modem combos.\nA switch is a networking device that connects devices together. Usually physically, via ethernet cables. The word switch usually means a device that forwards data between devices at the layer 2 level using MAC addresses. There is such a thing as layer 3 switches, which incorporate some routing functionality. Routers usually have a kind of switch built-in to them. \nTypes of Networks\nThe internet is a network of networks. \nA Local Area Network (LAN) is a small private network. For example, all the devices (computers, phones, tablets) in your home connected to your wifi network comprise a LAN. \nA Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is the network of a town or city.\nA Wide Area Network (WAN) is a very large network owned and maintained by multiple stakeholders.\nLayers (OSI Model)\nNetworking is electricity on wires. And it's data. But it is also protocols. And it is also packets. And servers. And sometime data is encrypted and sometimes it's compressed. And different data moves differently. Point is that there's lots of ways to talk about networking, and there's lots of lays of abstraction. \nThe same data can be discussed in many ways, and most people use the OSI model as a guide. So when people are saying L2, L4 – it is usually in reference to the OSI model.\nOSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection model, but nobody knows that or ever says it out loud.\n#Namethings that happen\n7ApplicationWhat the user interacts with, http, ftp\n6PresentationHandler encryption, decryption, compression, decompression.\n5Sessionchannels, called sessions, between devices.\n4TransportTCP, UDP\n3NetworkDeciding what physical path the packets will take\n2Data Linkdefine the format of the data/packets\n1Physicalthe physical bit, electricity on a wire kind of shit\n\nAlthough the OSI model gets all the attention, there's actually other models. TCP/IP, the protocol that runs the internet, actually has it's own model defined in RFC 1122/RFC 1123. It is a simpler model with only 4 layers.\n#NameOSI Layers\n4ApplicationApplication (7) + Presentation (6) + Session (5)\n3TransportTransport (4)\n2InternetNetwork (3)\n1LinkLink (2)\n\nPersonally, this makes more sense to because I don't know enough about the details of OSI layers 5 through 7 to consider them separate layers.\nIP Addresses, IPv4, IPv6\nIP addresses are strings of numbers that correspond to a unique device on some network. \nIPv4 addresses are made of 32 bits which usually organized into 4 bytes (also sometimes, thought rarely, called octets).\nIPv6 addresses are made of 128 bits and usually written in hex.\nIf you have lots of zeros, you may omit them.\nPairs of equivalent IPv6 addresses:\n2001:0db8:c9d2:0012:0000:0000:0000:0051\n2001:db8:c9d2:12::51\n\n2001:0db8:ab00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\n2001:db8:ab00::\n\n0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001\n::1\n\nThe address ::1 is the loopback address. It always means this machine I’m running on now. \nIn IPv4, the loopback address is 127.0.0.1.\nThere’s an IPv4-compatibility mode for IPv6 addresses. To represent the IPv4 address 192.0.2.33 as an IPv6 address you write it like this: ::ffff:192.0.2.33\nPackets, Frames, Etc.\nData is bytes.\nTo share data through a network, there needs to be a common protocol that everyone agrees on, and data bytes must be in a specific format.\nThe most used data units in networks are the packet, frame, and datagram.\nThe word packet is often used as a catchall term for all the previously mention data units as well as others, but when you say packet and you want to refer to a specify type of packet called a packet, you probably mean an internet packet (IP).\nInternet Packets are used for connection-oriented protocols.\nData is divided into packets, sent over the internet, then recombined to recreate the original data at its destination.\nPackets are data units with the network layer (L3) of OSI.\nThere are limits to the size of IP packets. It is defined by something called MTU, a Maximum Transmitted Unit. If packets are bigger than the MTU of a network, then they are broken up into smaller pieces of data called fragments. The network layer (L3) is also responsible for fragmentation.\nPackets have DF flag, “Don’t Fragment.” If the DF flag is set to 1, and the size of the packet is bigger than the MTU of the packet, the packet is discarded. \nNext there are frames.\nThe main difference between a packet and a frame is its association with the OSI layers. While a packet is used in the network layer, a frame is a unit of data in the data link layer. Frames are used by Ethernet.\nA frame contains more information about the transmitted message than a packet. Like some flags, MAC addresses, etc.\nDatagrams are used for connectionless protocols like UDP.\nSockets\nSockets are the endpoints of communication.\nSocket is a big word. Like packets, its a bit of a catch-all. However in networking we are usually we are talking about Internet Sockets.\nA socket allows programs to communicate to each other by using Unix file descriptors, sometimes over a network. \nA file descriptor is just an integer associated with an open file. \nThat file can be anything: a network connection, a pipe a terminal, a picture of a cat, whatever. This comes from the Unix philosophy that everything in Unix is a file. When Unix systems do any kind of I/O the do so by reading or writing to a file descriptor.\nInternet sockets are also called DARPA Internet addresses. But no one says that.\nThere are also many types of internet sockets, but we are going to talk about two kinds: Stream Sockets and Datagram Sockets. (Another interesting, and very powerful type of internet socket is a Raw Socket).\nStream sockets are reliable two-way connected internet streams. Things get output the same order they were input. Stream sockets use a protocol called Transmission Control Protocol, TCP. TCP makes ensures data arrive sequentially and error-free.\nTCP is often heard when saying TCP/IP. IP stands for Internet Protocol and primarily deals with internet routing and is not concerned with data integrity.\nDatagram sockets don’t care about order. They don’t care if they arrive where they are supposed to or not. If it does arrive though, the data in the packet will be error-free. Datagrams also use IP for routing, but they don’t use TCP, they use UDP. \n\nWanna hear a joke about UDP? ...nevermind you probably wouldn't get it.\n\nA socket address is usually a combination of a file descriptor, an IP address and a port number. TCP/IP creates socket addresses that is unique throughout all Internet networks. Those socket addresses are used to read data on one machine and write it on another, and transmit that data via packets.\nRouting\nTODO\nWiFi Networks &amp; Security\nFirst of all, WiFi stands for nothing. Annoying.\nWPA stands for Wifi Protected Access. WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 are security certification programs developed by the wifi alliance to secure wireless computer networks. Routers use WPA* to communicate wirelessly with devices and then send that data off into the WAN.\nWPA is broken, we mostly use WPA2 now.\nTLS stand for Transport Layer Security. It is the newer version and successor of (the now depreciated) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It is used, most commonly, in securing HTTPS.  (HTTPS means HTTP over SSL/TLS).\nWe are now at TLS 1.3, released in 2018. TLS 1.2 was released in 2008, TLS 1.1 in 2006, and TLS 1.0 in 1999.\nTLS/SSL use certificates to provide privacy/confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. It runs in the application layer and it composed of two layers itself the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols.\nTLS certificates are a type of digital certificate issued by a CA (Certificate Authority).\nDigital certificates (aka identity certificates or public key certificates) are digital files used to certify the ownership of a public key.\nEach TLS certificate consists of a key pair made of a public key and private key.\nThe server shares its TLS/SSL certificate and its public key with the client to establish a secure connection and a unique session key.\nTTLS stands for tunnelled TLS. \nTunnelling in networking refers to the encapsulation of packets: wrapping packets inside of other packets.\nTunnelling can be used to set up secure connections between networks, enable the usage of unsupported protocols, and sometimes bypass firewalls.\nPackets can be split into 2 parts: the header and the payload. The header indicates the packets destination (among other things) and the payload is the actual content. To encapsulate packet A into packet B, the header and payload of packet A become the payload of packet B.\nA VPN (virtual private network) is a secure, encrypted connection over a public network. Basically you send data over an insecure network (anyone can connect and listen in) and encapsulate your packets and encrypt their payloads. Spilt tunnelling is when you route some of your data through your VPN and some through some other network.\nSecure Shell Tunnel.\nThe difference between VPN and SSH tunnels is that in VPN tunnelling, the security comes from altering the data that you want to send and sending through an insecure medium. In SSH, you create a private network (via a public network) and then send your data through a secure channel, so your data doesn’t necessarily need to be encrypted. Another difference is that VPN runs in the transport layer, while SSH runs in the application layer.\nMore\nHosting etc. services\n\nAWS (free tier)\nGCP (free tier)\nLinode\n\nCheap and decent domain name registrar:\n\nNamecheap.com\n\nVPN\n\nTailScale \nHeadScale\n\nOnline Books\n\nHigh Performance Browser Networking (O'Reilly)\nBeej's Guide to Network Programming\n\nJulia Evan's Legendary Zines\n\nNetworking\ntcpdump\n\nCool Web Tools\n\nmesswithdns.net \ndns-lookup.jvns.ca\n\n","id":"https://jxlxx.org/posts/04-networking-basics/","title":"Networking Basics"},"https://jxlxx.org/posts/05-aws-basics/":{"body":"Link to the course (it's free btw)\nModule 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services\nOverview of AWS infrastructure\n\nAWS resources are in Availability Zones\nAvailability Zones are in Regions\nus-east-2 is a region\nus-east-2a is an availability zone\nServices are deployed at either a Global, Region, or AZ level\nSome service require you choose an AZ\n\nIAM\n\nWhen you create an account with email and password that’s called a root user\nEmail/password combo is one set of credentials but you get another set of credentials called access keys, they allow you to use CLI or AWS SDKs\nAccess keys have two parts: access key ID and secret access key\nIAM is global and not specific to regions\n\nDemo\n\nEvery AWS resource must live inside of a network\nAWS provides a default VPC, virtual private network\n\nModule 2: AWS Compute\nAMI: Amazon Machine Image\nWhen selecting an instance type and size, you see: t3.medium or a1.large\n\nt3 and a1 is the instance family/type + generation, determines the hardware capabilities\nmedium and large is the instance size (vCPUS, memory, etc)\nyou only get charged while in the running state, of in the stopping (preparing to hibernate)\n\nWild Rydes Web Application\nAWS Serverless Whitepaper\nModule 3: AWS Networking\n\nIn AWS, the smallest IP range you can have is /28, which provides 16 IP addresses. The largest IP range you can have is a /16, which provides 65,536 IP addresses.\n\nTo create a VPC, we need to set 2 things:\n\nregion\nIP range\n\nVPC are split into subnets, and then you put your AWS resources into these subnets.\nTo provide more control over access of resources.\nTo create a Subnet, we need 3 things:\n\nthe VPC it will live in\nthe AZ it will live in\nIP range (subset of the VPC)\n\nVPCs need Internet Gateways (IGW) to connect to the internet.\nIf you only want traffic from a specific place, for example an on-premises datacenter, then you can create Virtual Private Gateway (VGW).\nAWS reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet. \n\n10.0.0.0: Network address.\n= 10.0.0.1: Reserved for the VPC router.\n10.0.0.2: The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two. \n10.0.0.3: Reserved for future use. (?)\n10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, so they reserve this address.\n\nHow does traffic get routed through the VPC?\nWhen you create a VPC, AWS creates a route table called the main route table.\nA route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where traffic is directed.\nDefault configuration allows traffic between all the subnets in the local network.\nNetwork Access Control List (Network ACL) can be thought of as a firewall at the subnet level. \nYou can use it to only allow HTTPS traffic in and out of your subnet. Remember if you make a rule to only allow HTTPS traffic in, you have to also make a rule to allow HTTPS traffic out.\nA NAT Gateway provides internet connectivity to instances and private subnets. A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation service. You can use a NAT gateway to so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your subnet.\nThe next layer of security is a Security Group. This is a firewall at the EC2 level. Security groups are not optional. The default configuration of a new security group blocks all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. This ok and works because security groups will remember if a connection if originally initiated by the EC2 instance or outside and will temporarily allow traffic to respond with modifying the inbound rules.\nModule 4: AWS Storage\nAWS storage services are grouped into 3 categories: block storage, file storage, and object storage.\nFile storage: It's what it sounds like, it’s a file system. Each file has metadata like file name, file size, created date, etc. And files have paths. File storage is good when \nyou require centralized access to file that need to be easily shared and managed by multiple host computers.\nBlock storage: splits of data into block, considers each block it’s own thing\n\ngood for things that gets updated a lot because you will only need to update individual blocks not the whole thing\n\nObject storage: considers each object its own thing.\n- WORM: write once, read many\nEBS, elastic block storage  , is like an external drive. Persistent storage.\n\nEC2 instance storage in the machines drives, but are not saved when the instance is terminated.\nSnapshots are saved from EBS as backups.\nUnlike EBS, which requires a EC2 instance to be used, Amazon S3 is a standalone storage solution.\n\nS3 is object storage. \n\nS3 objects are stored in a flat structure using unique identifiers for look up.\nIn S3, you store objects in buckets. This is mandatory.\nAt minimum, you need to specify 2 details: the region and the bucket name.\nBucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts (like in the world).\nEverything in Amazon S3 is private by default (can. only be viewed by the AWS account that created that resource).\nTwo ways to change/have more control over this: IAM policies &amp; S3 bucket policies\n\nYou can specify in IAM policies what users are allowed to do to buckets\nOr, you can specify on the bucket side what’s allowed to happen to that bucket\n\n\nAmazon S3 reinforces encryption in transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest\nYou can use S3 versioning. Default behaviour is that objects get overwritten when they get sent to S3.\nThere are 6 different S3 storage classes that are optimized for different things.\n\nYou can automate automatic tier transitions with object life cycle management. You can choose:\n\nTransition actions: when objects should transition to another storage class\nExpiration actions: when objects expire and should be permanently deleted\n\nModule 5: Databases\nnothing of note\nModule 6: Monitoring, Optimization, and Serverless\n\nload balancing: distributing tasks across a set of resources\nyou can run a load balancer on an EC2 instance or use ELB\nELB makes health checks to services to determine whether it should send traffic their way\nELB is actually really scalable even if it looks like it isn’t\n\nApplication Load Balancer — Layer 7: HTTP/HTTPS\nNetwork Load Balancer — Layer 4: TCP/UDP/TLS\nGateway Load Balancer — Layer 3+4: IP\n\nThe ALB is made up of 3 components: rules, listeners, and target groups\n\ntarget group: the backend servers are defined in one or more target groups. This where traffic is directed. You must define a health check for each target group.\nlistener: the client connects to the listener. To  define a listener you must provide a port and a protocol. There can be many listener for a single LB. Ex. listen to port 80 for http traffic.\nrule: conditions that map clients to target groups\n\n\n\nYou can have internal or external load balancers. For use within your network or internet facing.\nALB makes routing decisions based on the HTTP protocol, like the URL path (/upload) and host, HTTP headers and method, and the source IP address of the client.\nALB uses sticky sessions. If requests must be sent to the same backend server because the application is stateful, use the sticky session feature. This feature uses an HTTP cookie to remember across connections which server to send the traffic to.\nNLBs do not understand what an HTTP request is.\nNLBs use a flow hash routing algorithm. The algorithm is based on:\n\nprotocol\nsource ip and port\ndestination ip and port\nTCP sequence number\n\nIf all those params are the same, it goes to the same target\n","id":"https://jxlxx.org/posts/05-aws-basics/","title":"AWS Technical Essentials Course Notes"},"https://jxlxx.org/posts/06-aws-cdk-basics/":{"body":"What is CDK?\nCloud Development Kit.\nImagine… You are running some kind of software business.\nYou’re most likely not self-hosting, and instead using some kind of cloud provider.\nSomething like: AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean, Linode… etc.\nWhat are the kinds of services you need? \nDomain NameRoute53\nSSLCertificate Manager\nCDNCloudFront\nStatic Assets, etcS3\nDatabaseRDS, Dynamo, Aurora, etc\nAuthenticationCognito\nREST APIAPI Gateway\nBusiness Logic StuffLambda, EC2\nContainer managementECR\n\nYou also probably want a Dev, Stag, and Prod stack.\nSo a CDK is code that you write, which generates CloudFormation Templates (JSON or YAML), which you push to AWS CloudFormation, and then that builds your AWS infrastructure.\nAnd CloudFormation Templates are ANNOYING. \nHow to start a CDK project\nGet the code: git checkout v1\nEvery CDK app should be in its own directory.\nFor this tutorial, all my code is in /BackendGuild.

Moving on.\nNow let’s look at lib/name-stack.ts\nimport * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';\nimport * as sns from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns';\nimport * as subs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns-subscriptions';\nimport * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';\n\nexport class CdkWorkshopStack extends cdk.Stack {\n  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'CdkWorkshopQueue', {\n      visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)\n    });\n\n    const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'CdkWorkshopTopic');\n\n    topic.addSubscription(new subs.SqsSubscription(queue));\n  }\n}\n\nThis does three main things:\n\nCreates an SQS Queue\nSNS Topic\nSubscribes the 1 to receive any messages published to 2\n\nscope , id, and props\nscope is always the first argument in which constructs are created. Usually you just pass in this, because you want to define constructs with the current construct.\nid is the local identity of the construct, a unique way to refer to it with its scope.\nprops are initialization properties. The lambda props accepts properties like runtime, code, handler name.\nOur example: creating an S3 bucket\nFirst of all I had to add a couple environment variables:\n\nCDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT\nCDK_DEFAULT_REGION\n\nThen I ran cdk synth to see if everything looked good.\nThen I ran cdk bootstrap which creates a “bootstrap stack” for the app.\nNow I have a bunch of roles, a bucket, etc.\nFinally, I do:\ncdk deploy\n\nNow lets add some changes:\nimport * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';\nimport { Construct } from 'constructs';\nimport { aws_s3 as s3 } from 'aws-cdk-lib'\n\nexport class CdkWorkshopStack extends cdk.Stack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyThirdBucket', {\n        versioned: true,\n        removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,\n        autoDeleteObjects: true\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nAnd then run cdk diff:\nWhat else can you do?\nCheck the docs: class Bucket (construct) · AWS CDK\nImportant Commands\ncdk bootstrap\n\nThis installs a “bootstrap stack” of AWS stuff that will be used to create your stack\nThis stack includes resources that are used in the toolkit’s operation\nFor example, you can store code in an S3 bucket and use that during the deployment process\n\ncdk synth \n\ngenerates the cloudformation templates\n\ncdk deploy\n\nactually deploys to aws\n\ncdk diff\n\nif you make changes to the cdk this will show you what’s been changes\n\ncdk deploy --hotswap\n\nthis will try to update the infrastructure you currently have with any changes you make\nfor example if you want to disable versioning for a bucket or change it’s privacy settings\n\ncdk watch\n\nthis will watch your code for changes and try to deploy if it can\nbut you can only make asset changes\nfor example you cannot disable/enable versioning but you can adda picture/data to the contents of the bucket\n\nnote: These commands deliberately introduces drift in CloudFormation stacks in order to speed up deployments.\nDrift is when you cloud formation templates don’t match your actual stack.\ncdk destroy\n\ndestroys stuff 💀 \n\nWhat is AWS Lambda\nAWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. \nWhat do you need:\n\na name\na trigger\ncode (either a script or an executable in a zip)\na runtime\n(optional) layers\n\nWhat is a layer?\nA layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package.\nLet’s use lambda\nAdding an AWS lambda function\n\ncreate a directory lambda in the root of the CDK app\nadd a line to .gitignore to NOT ignore all the .js files in lambda\n\n!lambda/*\n\n\nadd the following js file, lambda/hello.js\n\nexports.handler = async function(event) {\n  console.log(\"request:\", JSON.stringify(event, undefined, 2));\n  return {\n    statusCode: 200,\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\" },\n    body: `Hello, CDK! You've hit ${event.path}\\n`\n  };\n};\n\nThis is a lambda function that always returns the text “Hello, CDK!

It's also very easy -- I'm surprised I didn't do this as a child. I started doing it in university after discovering craft beer and also discovering how expensive craft beer is. Anyways, it is a fun, easy, rewarding, and financially responsible hobby that more people should get into.\t\nFirst of all, cider usually means apple cider. And then people call cider made of pears, perry. And some people say that perry is techically not cider -- it's perry. But personally, I don't care. I call it all cider. I made have made an alcoholic beverage with just yeast, water, and table sugar -- I still called it cider. Who cares. (and yes, it did not taste good -- that wasn't the point)\nAnyways. There are four essential things you need to make alcohol:\n\nA vessel\nSugar\nWater\nYeast\n\nAnd sometimes 2, 3, and 4 can be found all together in a neat little package in the form of organic juice.\nSure, there are other things you can use or add, but these are the only things that are critical.\nThese four things fall into one of two catagories:\n\ntools\ningredients\n\nA vessel is a tool. Some other tools you might use are: a funnel, a sieve, a hydrometer (to message alcohol content), etc.\nAs for ingredients, that's really up to you as well. I won't talk about ingredients in depth until the ingredients section at the end.\nThe tools 🔨\nAny vessel with a tight seal will work. I have personally made alcohol in:\n\nrandom shitty jars\nhigh quality mason jars\nbig plastic single use juice bottles\nwine bottles\nbig weird container things for uncooked spaghetti\nglass drink dispenser things \nwho knows what else\n\nThe purpose of the vessel, other than a glorified bowl, is to make an airtight seal so that bacteria that will turn the cider to vinegar will not get in. Vinegar means no alcohol, which is bad if you are trying to make alcohol.\nA great starter vessel is the mason jar. Easy to find. Cheap. And all things considered, does a create job at making a seal. (Maybe too great, see the next section)\nThe dangers ⚠️\nYou can skip this section if you don't care if you live or die.\nLet's take a moment to discuss the \"dangers\" of making alcohol this way... If you stick to the things I mention in this list, probably nothing will ever go wrong. The worst thing that could happen is you get a batch of vinegar instead of alcohol -- not the end of the world.\n\nBotulism\n\nPeople's first concern is botulism. Botulism is a concern when you are canning, not when you are fermenting. The bacteria that can cause botulism cannot survive in our concoctions.\n\nExplosions\n\nTo be fair, I have had one or two \"explosions\" (depending on how define explosions). \nThe first one was a 1.5L wine bottle filled with blackberry purée. My dumbass roommate (whomst I love) was vigously shaking the bottle to \"get all the flavours out\" and then said \"hmm... I'm gonna tighten this already sealed bottle even more\" and then twisted the cap past its threshold of twisted-ness and I watched in slow motion as this 1.5L bottle somehow became a firehose of blackberry sauce that sprayed across our kitchen, dining room, and living room. I'll never forget watching him aim it into the kitchen sink to try to contain the damage, and then see all the juice sprayed back out of the sink somehow covering an even wider surface area. It took us 6 hours to clean up and we had a purple ceiling for the next 6 months (bleach got the stain out). Any so that's something to consider if you are using something with a high volume to exit area ration type of vessel.\nThe second was much more dangerous. But also a special case. And it was also my roommates fault.\nWe had started making cider in large batches, 10L+, in a large food grade bucket. At the end of one of the fermentation cycles we had the bright idea to save the yeast colony of the batch for the next round,  in hopes that it would give us a more consistent flavour and shorter ferment time (not a bad idea honestly). The yeast was a thick, bright orange sludge, which we put in a mason jar. We then put the mason jar in our special minifridge which we exclusively use for our homebrew. This would have probably been fine... except before we put the jar in the fridge my roommate said, \"Hey, I'm gonna dump a cup of sugar in with the yeast -- so it doesn't get hungry.\" This turn the yeast jar into a glass bomb. Then the next day we went away for a week for winter break. While we were gone the thing exploded. Luckily no one was hurt and most of the mess and glass was contained in the minifridge. \nAnyways... yeah... don't do that. If you are using glassware that could be potentially sealed so tightly that the only way to release pressure is for it to explode -- don't add so much yeast and sugar. I was never concerned with regular amounts of sugar and yeast, even in tightly sealed mason jars. By regular amounts, I mean something that it intended to be drinkable. When you open/burp them, you can feel the pressure and it certainly doesn't feel glass explosion worthy. \nLevel One : Mason Jars 👶🏼\nLike I said before, mason jars are a pretty decent starter option if you want to keep costs low and you don't want a ton of equipment flying around. I typically buy those pasta sauces that come in mason jars (although they tend to be a bit small) and use those. It's also really fun to experiment with mason jars because you can have a bunch of ciders going at once and they are easy to maintain.\nA 1L mason is ideal, but you can go smaller (are there larger ones 🤔).\nTypically the process is like this:\n\nThoroughly clean the mason jar.\nAdd ingredients &amp; seal.\nPut the jar in a dark place and wait. \nCheck on it occasionally. Burp to relieve pressure. Taste test.\nDone. (drink or put in the fridge)\n\nHow often you wait and check depends on your ingredients and your climate. Sometimes, yeast will thrive and you will quickly get your desired alcohol level. Sometimes it will go slowly. Sometimes it will get \"stuck\".\nYou will be able to gauge the activity level based on bubbles/movement in the jar. There's nothing better than seeing those first bubz 🥲.\nLevel Two : Bucket + Airlock + Secondary Vessels 👷🏽‍♀️\nBucket\nOnce you find a recipe you like, the first thing you probably want to do is make more of it.\nSo the best thing to do would be getting a big plastic bucket. \nThese buckets look just like those ten gallon paint buckets, but it should be food grade if you want to use it for cider.\nAnd I hate to say it but you should probably buy new, plastic is porous (I hate to say it because my equipment was bought used 😳).\nIn addition to a bucket, you will need an airlock (to be discussed in the next section). Also, if you are buying from a homebrew shop the bucket will probably have a hole in the lid for the airlock but otherwise you will have to make it yourself.\nYou will also need some tubes to siphon the cider out of the bucket. You could also get a pump to make it more hygenic to siphon or you can just suck on the tube. To each their own. You will need a rigid tube the length of the bucket (ideally that fits in the airlock hole) and a long soft tube that's at least a meter/3'.\nAir Lock\nNow if you are using a big bucket to make alcohol, you do NOT want to be worrying about pressure. \nSo you definetely will need an airlock. An airlock will allow air to leave the vessel but not enter it. This means that pressure won't build up and you won't have to burp it or worry about an explosion.\nSecondary vessels\nIn Level One, you ferment in a jar and when your creating is ready you either drink it straight from the jar (I mean who hasn't), pour into a glass and drink, or put the whole thing in the fridge to drink later. \nYou may come to find that this system is actually pretty inconvient. For example, when you are showing off your beverages, some people can be pretty offput by the jar situation. Most critically though, if you are saving your drink for later, you may find that the flavour changes as time goes on. This is because even though it is in the fridge, the fermentation process hasn't stopped, it's only slowed down. \nAlso, if you have upgraded to an airlock situation, we will find that you drink will not be carbonated. Which is very sad. Carbonation happens because while the yeast is creting alcohol, it is also creating CO2. If it's in a sealed vessel, that CO2 will cause the cider to carbonate. If there is an airlock, it will just leave the vessel. \nSo to combat all these issues, we split up fermentation into two processes. The first fermentation happens in your airlocked vessel. Once you have your desired ABV and flavour, you transfer your cider to jars or bottles or something -- without an airlock -- and seal them. You have to do your best to not include the thick yeast sludge into the second ferment, but some will make in anyways. This will be enough to carbonate and continue the fermentation a bit longer.\nSo the process will be like this:\n\nThoroughly clean the bucket.\nAdd ingredients, close with airlock.\nPut the jar in a dark place and wait. \nCheck on it occasionally. Taste test.\nBottle or jar.\nLet sit somewhere dark and warm. \nDone. (drink or put in the fridge)\n\nLevel Three : Measuring + Bottling 🥷\nMeasuring ABV by gravity\nThe only thing about this is that if you have whole fruits in the primary fermentation, the numbers might be off. How much I don't know! I'm not a chemist.\nABV means Alcohol By Volume. A 5% beer means that 5% of the the beer you're drinking is pure alcohol (ethanol).\nTo do this, you need a test tube and a hydrometer. All you have to do is fill the test tube with cider cider before fermentation and after, and put the hydrometer in there with it. The difference between the starting and finishing number will tell you the ABV.\nA bottler\nA bottler is a really nice way to make you cider more appealing to the masses. \nNo matter what it tastes like, some people -- many people -- will always judge drinks that come from buckets or jars 😢.\nYou don't have to buy new bottles and caps. You can reuse old ones! Which means you have a good reason to buy a couple cases of Coronas! It will save you money in the long run, okay?? It doesn't even have to be Corona, I just like them because they are clear bottles (and I like how Coronas taste). All that matter is that they are not twist-offs.\nWhat to do what your fermentation gets \"stuck\"\nSometimes -- and this is much more likely if you are using cheap juice -- your fermentation will get \"stuck\". It won't get alcoholic, it won't turn into vinegar... it will just... sit there. It might be dead, it might be taking a nap (yeast can hibernate). In this case, take some of the not-yet-cider cider liquid out, warm it up a bit. Add some more yeast and wait to see if its active (bubbles, foam on top). Then add it back to your vessel. You should also make sure your vessel is in a warm spot overall.\nIngredients 🍎\nSo ingredients-wise, all you really need is: sugar, water, yeast. And you can accomplish this by just adding table sugar, tap water, and bread yeast. It's just won't taste very good. \nNon-alcoholic cider vs juice\nFrom southernliving.com:\n\nApple cider is fresh, unfiltered, and often unpasteurized. It's also considered a seasonal drink and can be hard to find outside of the autumn months. Apple juice, on the other hand, is filtered and pasteurized, which gives it a longer shelf life, a sweeter taste, and a smoother texture.\n\nPersonally, I love using non-alcoholic apple cider to make alcoholic apple cider. It's very easy to find in the fall and early winter months (gets really cheap towards the beginning of winter as well). \nOrganic vs Not Organic\nIf you go the organic route, you typically don’t have to add any yeast. And in my experience, get a higher ABV. \nAs a point of reference, in my experience, the cheap/fake noname juices peak at about 3.5% and the organic apple cider gets to about %7.\t\nHowever if you go non-organic, your ingredients will be way cheaper.\nAlso, lots of people like non-organic, cheap, fake, sugary juices from concentrate 🤷. \nJuice vs Fruits\nYou can choose to add chopped/blended/whole fruits, or fruit juice, or both. \nHowever if you use exclusively whole fruits, you will probably have to add some sugar (table sugar, honey, etc) to the medium (water). \nAlso, if you use any whole fruits at all, the typical way of measuring ABV -- by measuring the gravity of the medium before and after fermentation -- will no longer be valid. \nIf you are blending fruits and make the liquid too viscous, it while get gross because you won't be able to seperate the yeast from it. So what you can do is strain your blend. Put the juice part in the medium and put the solid in a mash bag. A mash bag is a bag made of cheese cloth or something like that. It basically will act as a tea back in your cider. So you will still get the benefit of use actual fruits, but you should still get something drinkable at the end.\nJuice is definetly the easiest way to go. But whole fruits are fun.\nTypes of Fruits\nSome of my thoughts...\nApples - A classic. Ferments easily, but not as crazy as the stone fruits. Good flavour. \nBerries - I have only tried a few types of berries and usually in a mix. They are expensive where I live usually. So this is a catagory I need to experiment in more. The only thing I will add is that you might need a mash bag (cheesecloth tea bag thing) if you are using berries that might fall apart (blackberries, raspberries, etcß).\nCitrus family - I would say leave out citrus, unless you're feeling experimental. I found that when I added lemons/limes/oranges to ciders it typically created something that tasted like dishwashing soap. If you really want something citrus-y/sour, I would advise maybe just adding some juice after the first fermentation before bottling.\nGinger - Lovely addition. The ginger flavour persists after fermentation. Adds a bit of warmth...  a bit of a kick... Excellent.\t\nGrapes - Fermented well, tasted a bit weird. Was not like wine if that's what you're thinking. Probably would have done better in a mash bag.\nPeaches, plums, and other stone fruits - Excellent options. These guys WANT to be fermented. If you are not using an airlock you will have to be careful that your vessel doesn't leak or warp or explode. And the flavour works. If stone fruits weren't so delicous on their own (and also less expensive) I would be making a lot more of these types of ciders.\nTypes of Yeast\nTypically you will be advised to use champagne yeast. This is a special yeast that is supposed to be able to survive in high alcohol environments. I have had mixed results with it. It doesn't matter if you have the best yeast in the world if its dead. Or if you are making cider with no-name peach juice from concentrate for that matter. \nBread and pizza yeast is fine. I have also used but active dry and instant yeast interchangeably without noticing a difference. \nMy favourite method is to just use old fruits or organic juice and to not add any yeast directly at all. The main reason is that then there is less yeast by-product in the final drink. But also it's easier and another variable that's out of my hands and I don't have to worry about.\nIf you are super fancy, you can also use fresh yeast. I think I did this once. No memory of the results though. Take from that what you will.\nTypes of Sugar\nBesides the sugar that comes along with your fruit/juice, you can add sugars like: \n\nwhite table sugar\nbrown sugar\nraw sugar \nhoney\nagave syrup \n\nWhite table sugar adds sweetness, without much else. All the other options add sweetness plus their own flavour profile -- so it really just depends on what you're into.\nRecipes 🧑🏾‍🍳\nRecipe: Dry Organic Cider\nIf you go the organic apple cider route, you don’t have to add any yeast! Or sugar! Also in my experience, organic apple cider got the dryest and most alcoholic, clocking in at about 7%.\nIngredients: Organic Apple Cider.\nTime: About a week.\nABV: ~7%\nNotes: Although this is my favourite, I don't think it's the favourite of most people. The apple taste is completely gone. What remains is difficult to describe. But what can I say, after years of experimentation, this is what my tastebuds drift towards. Also it's 7%!!\t\nRecipe: Jungle Juice\nBuy the cheapest juices you can find and mix them all together. \nI would stay away from citrus heavy blends, but a blend of equal parts: apple, peach, grape, is a crowd pleaser.\nIngredients: Cheap juice. 1/4 tsp yeast per litre.\nTime: About a week in warm weather.\nABV: ~3-4%\nNotes: I was surprised at how much people like this one. Fancy, fancy people preferred it to the super dry, organic cider (maybe because this is the first one we bottled?). Personally I find it too similar to the juice it once was, and far too sweet (I don't like sweets in general though, to an extreme degree). Letting it go for longer never seemed to make it more alcoholic though.\nRecipe: Chunky Jungle Juice\nChop up a random mix of old (but not rotting) fruits, add water and juice. You probably want about 3-4 apple sized fruits per liter (does that make sense? yes).\nAlternatively, if you don't want to add juice you could add sugar water (but juice would be easier). Or do 50% water / 50% juice to bring down the alcohol/sweetness of the final product.\nThis is an excellent beverage to bring out at a party once most people are minimum 3 drinks in. At least in your early 20s. Not sure after that though.\nIngredients: Random fruits. 1/4 tsp yeast per litre. Water to fill the vessel.\nTime: About a week in warm weather.\nABV: ~3-4%\nNotes: Also, if you do the cheapest possible juice route, it will not get as alcoholic and will keep a bit of its sweetness, not sure why. Perhaps the preservatives in the juice are bad for the yeast? I'm not a scientist.\nRecipe: Dry Hopped Cider\nTake the organic apple cider recipe and add a handfull of hops in the secondary fermentation (if you are only doing one fermentation, then the first will do as well).\nAdd more or less hops depending on how much you like hops. If you are adding dried/pellet hops, start with a tsp per liter (even if you like hops). Dried whole hops, you can be a bit more carefree with. \nRecipe: Ginger Beer\nIngredients: Some ginger, about 30 cm3 per liter. 4 tbs sugar per liter. 1/4 tsp yeast per litre.\nTime: About a week in warm weather.\nABV: ~3-4% (guessing because I never actually measured this guy)\nNotes: I just peeled and sliced the ginger. Nothing crazy. \nRecipe: Laziest Cider of All Time\nBuy a plastic jug of a couple litres of juice. (any will work, I did this with blue hawaiian punch once). Open it. Add a half tsp of yeast (any). Close and put somewhere warm. Burp every day or two. You should have an alcoholic beverage in a week or so :)\n","id":"https://jxlxx.org/posts/08-how-to-alcohol/","title":"How to Make Alcohol in a Jar 🍻"},"https://jxlxx.org/posts/go-essentials/":{"body":"Background\nGo was designed at Google. \nIt is sometimes called Golang, but its official name is Go. \nHowever, if you are looking up any documentation/StackOverflow stuff you will most likely have to say Golang instead of just Go.\nGo is a statically typed, compiled, high-level language designed for concurrency.\nOne of the inventors of Go is Ken Thompson, the guy who invented the C programming language.\nGo came about because Thompson and the others’ collective distaste for C++. Here is a quote from the guy:\nKT: Yes. When the three of us [Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer] got started, it was pure research. \nThe three of us got together and decided that we hated C++. [laughter]\nsource: interview with KT\nThis post is intended to be a short reference to give programmers new to Go enough context to hit the ground running. \nGo is actually a very simple language (in a good way) so it's easy to get started if you have\nsome experience with any other typed and compiled language. I might even go as far as to say\nthat it is the easiest typed and compiled langauge to learn these days 😳\nWe will briefly talk about:\n\na simple hello, world example\npackages and modules\nfunctions, methods, variables\nerror handling\ngoroutines (and defer)\nchannels (and select)\nwaitgroups\ncontexts\ninterfaces\nproject structure\ngofmt (and go.dev/play)\n\nHello, 世界!\nFirst, let's have a quick look at a simple hello world program in Go. \nYou can go to https://go.dev/play/ to run it yourself.\n\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, 世界\")\n  }\n\t\n\nThere are 4 details that leap out at us immediately and lead to some natural questions.\n\nWe are looking at a package called main (what is a package?)\nWe are importing something called fmt (what is fmt?)\nWe are defining a function called main (is there something special about the name main?)\nWe are calling a function from fmt called Println (why is is capitalized?)\n\nLet's start with answering those 4 burning questions, and then we will get into concurrency and other fancy stuff.\nPackages and modules\nGo projects are composed of packages  and modules.\nA package is a directory of Go files (*.go) that do something and are somehow related (ideally, but I guess you can do whatever you want).\nAll the files in a package contain the line: package package_name. In this case we have a main package,\nprobably defined in a file called main.go.\n\n💡 You can search for publicly available packages here: pkg.go.dev \n\nA module is a collection of one or more go packages that is versioned and has dependencies.\nA module is identified by a module path, which is the canonical name for the module.\nModule paths usually have two parts to them, the path part and the name part.\nThe path part specificies where the module is being imported from, of the module and the name is the just the name of the module.\nFor example, the Gin web framework has a module path: github.com/gin-gonic/gin\nThe package is called gin and the code repository is hosted at https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin.\nBut unless you are writing some open source Go software (in which case you really don't need to be reading this article), you don't have to \nworry about the path part. Many tutorials tell you to use github.com/&lt;your_username&gt;/&lt;package_name&gt;, but it's not at all necessary when you are just learning\nor working on your own small projects. This is the suggested path because it will prevent path collisions with other peoples packages when you are a wildly successful\nopen source dev. \nHowever, your machine and the Go compiler need to know where you are keeping your go code and your imported packages. \nThis information is stored in the $GOPATH environment variable. You can see all Go related environment variables with go env.\nAccording the Go website, Go developers usually keep all their Go code/projects in own directory called a Workspace (I do not. Ever heard of Nix, you nerds?).\nFor example, the workspace of a professional Go developer might look like this:\n.\n├── pkg // contains compiled go packages that are\n│       // later used to create binary executable in bin\n│\n├── bin\n│   ├── company_app\n│   └── personal_project\n│\n└── src\n    ├── github.com/my_company_github/company_app\n    │   ├── .git\n    │   └── ... go code\n    │   \n    └── github.com/my_github/personal_project\n        ├── .git\n        └── ... go code\n      \n\nAnd the $GOPATH should be set to that directory. \n\n💡 There is some information on structuring individual Go projects here: # project structure\n\nAnyways, back to modules.\nModules usually must have have a go.mod file, which defines the module path and the modules direct and indirect dependencies.\n(Technically, you don't need to have one, but I cannot think of a good reason why you wouldn't).\nThe go.mod file is not meant to be created or edited by humans, although it is intended to be readable. \nThere are lost of commands to work with go.mod files, but the two important ones are go mod init and go mod tidy\ngo mod init creates a module and generates go.mod file in your current repository. \nYou can also optionally specify a module path like this: go mod init some/module/path \ngo mod tidy will look at the import statements in your code and add new dependencies and remove dependencies that are no longer needed.\n\n💡 Here are some other things you can go with go mod: go.dev/ref/mod\n\nModules also usually have a go.sum file, which conatins cryptographic hashes of the modules' direct and indirect dependencies.\nSo in the end we have something like:\n.\n└── hello-world\n   ├── main.go\n   ├── go.mod\n   └── go.sum\n\n\nIs the word main, special? Yes, from the Go language specification: \n\nA complete program is created by linking a single, unimported package called the main package with all the packages it imports, transitively.\nThe main package must have package name main and declare a function main that takes no arguments and returns no value.\n\n\nProgram execution begins by initializing the main package and then invoking the function main. When that function invocation returns, \nthe program exits. It does not wait for other (non-main) goroutines to complete.\n\nThe fmt package\nThe fmt (\"format\") package is an I/O package in the Go standard library.\nIt defines functions analogous to C's printf and scanf.\nDefining functions, methods and variables\nThis is how you define a function in Go:\nfunc hello() {\n  // ... code ...\n}\n\nThis is how you specify arguments:\nfunc hello(name string, age int) {\n  // ... code ...\n}\n\nYou can also be cool and do this:\nfunc hello(first_name, last_name string, age int) {\n  // ... code ...\n}\n\nThis is how specify return types:\nfunc hello() string {\n  // ... code ...\n}\n\n// for multiple values, you need braces\nfunc hello_maybe() (string, error) {\n  // ... code ...\n}\n\nThere are two ways to define methods:\nstruct Server {\n  // ... fields\n}\n\n\nfunc (s Server) hello_value_reciever() {\n   // doing some stuff \n}\n\nfunc (s *Server) hello_pointer_reciever() {\n  // doing some stuff and maybe changing things in s\n}\n\nThe reason you would you use (s *Server), AKA a pointer reciever, is that it will allow you to make changes to the\ncaller, whereas you cannot change anything inside the caller if you are using a value reciever.\nPublic and private functions\nExposed values from other modules have to start with a capital. For example:\nfmt.Println(...) // this is perfectly fine :)\n\nfmt.padString(...) // not allowed, that's for `fmt` to know about, not you\n\nThis is also true for structs:\n\ntype Server struct {\n  secret string\n  NonSecret string  \n}\n\n\nVariables and underscores\nThere are two ways to declare variables. Explicitly saying the type or not saying the type and letting the compiler figure it out.\nvar x int // explicit\nx := 1    // implicit\n\nThe := means that the variable is being declared, aka set for the first time. When you are reassigning the value you do not use the colon.\ny := \"something\"\ny = \"another thing\"\n\nIf you have unused variables or imports, Go will complain and the build will fail. \nBut while developing you can get around this by using underscores. \n// don't use the colon, because nothing is being declared.\n_ = some_function()\n\n// Or, if you want one of the returned values\n_, used_var := another_function()\n\nAlso, you can use this technique to silence the unused imports error:\nimport _ \"fmt\" // i'll use this later\n\nYou can also rename the packages:\nimport api \"https://github.com/jxlxx/superlongpackagename\"\nimport other_api \"https://github.com/jxlxx/superlongpackagename2\"\n\nAnd also, you only need to say import once:\nimport (\n    \"time\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"context\"\n    )\n\nError Handling\nTypically in Go, you will see a pattern with errors over and over again.\nFunctions return: \n\nthe value you want \nand maybe an error\n\nBy maybe I mean it will either return nil or an error.\n\nSomeFunction (yourstring string) (string, error) {\n  if (yourstring == \"good string\") {\n    return \"thanks, that's a good string\", nil\t\n  } \n  // bad string\n  return \"\", errors.New(\"No thanks, bad string\")\n}\n\n\nThen, when you call a function you can either ignore the error \n(perhaps you know that the default value is fine) or handle it in some way:\n\nresponse, err := SomeFunction(\"good string\")\n\nif err != nil {\n  // here you will usually do something in response to the error and the\n  // function will return early\n  fmt.Println(\"an error!!!\")\n  return\n}\n// here you know that err == nil, so you can proceed with response\nfmt.Println(response)\n\n\nThis has a tendency to make your functions really long, but that's okay.\nGoroutines\nIf you are using Go, you probably want to make use of concurrency. \nYou can do this using goroutines, channels, and some other primitives that make life better. \nA goroutine is a thread managed by the Go runtime. \nThis is how you call a goroutine with no name:\n\ngo func() {\n  // do stuff\n}()\n\n\nAnd this is how you call a goroutine with a name:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  go sleep_and_print(5, \"this is called first but printed last\")\n  go sleep_and_print(1, \"this is called last but printed first\")\n\n  time.Sleep(10000)\n}\n\nfunc sleep_and_print(x int, y string) {\n  time.Sleep(time.Duration(x * 1000))\n  fmt.Println(y)\n}\n\n\nIsn't that nice?\nIn the above code we had to call time.Sleep(10000) at the end of main because \nafter the goroutines are called the main function keeps executing and exits without \nchecking on whether the goroutines terminated or not. \nSince go routines are managed by the go runtime, they are terminated when they return \nor when the program it’s self exits (main in this case). \nObviously, a sleep function is a terrible way to ensure \nthat our functions get executed. To communicate across goroutines we can make use of \nchannels and waitgroups.\nIs it possible for goroutines to leak? Yes.\nThere are many techniques to monitor for goroutine leaks, but I wouldn’t say that they are \nessential to get started with Go. \nBut here is something you can read, if you wish.\nDefer\nBefore getting into channels, etc. I want to mention a very lovely keyword defer. The defer keyword is \nplaced before a function call and it “defers” the executing of the function until right before the function that it is being called in, returns. \nAll the deferred functions will get executed in the reverse order that they were deferred. \nSo if I defer function A and then defer function B, then right before the function returns, \nB will be executed and then A will be executed.\nFirst Deferred, Last Executed. \n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  defer fmt.Println(\"A - deferred first\")\n  defer fmt.Println(\"B - deferred second\")\n\n  fmt.Println(\"C - first\")\n  fmt.Println(\"D - second\")\n}\n\n// Output: \n// C - first\n// D - second\n// B - deferred second\n// A - deferred first\n\n\ndefer is very useful when using channels as well, which we will get into soon.\nChannels\nA channel is a place to send and receive values in a way that is accessible to multiple goroutines.\nYou can have two kinds of channels: buffered and unbuffered.\nAn unbuffered channel means that you do not set a size limit when creating it, and it can grow freely.\nA buffered channel means that you give it a limit on how large in can grow when you declare it. \nThis is how you create both kinds of channels: \nunbuffered_channel := make(chan string)\n\nbuffered_channel := make(chan string, 2)\n\nmessage_channel := make(chan Message) // perhaps I have a Message struct\n\nThis is how you read and write from channels:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  messages := make(chan string, 1)\n\n  messages &lt;- \"hello\"                // adding a message to the channel\n  recieved_message, ok := &lt;-messages // receiving a message from a channel\n\n  if ok {\n    fmt.Println(recieved_message)\n  }\n}\n\n\nYou can close channels like this:\nclose(messages)\n\nHowever, you do not always have to close channels. They are not like files. You close channels as a \nway to say to the goroutines using them that there are no more values that are going to be sent to \nthe channel. \n\n💡 Link: How to Gracefully Close Channels\n\nBuffered channels are also called asynchronous channels.\nAnd unbuffered channels are also called synchronous channels.\nWhy? Well suppose  we made messages an unbuffered channel in the previous example, like this:\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  messages := make(chan string)\n\n  messages &lt;- \"hello\"                // adding a message to the channel\n  recieved_message, ok := &lt;-messages // receiving a message from a channel\n\n  if ok {\n    fmt.Println(recieved_message)\n  }\n  \n}\n\n// fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!\n\n\nIf we ran this code we would get a fatal runtime error. This is due to the line:\nmessages &lt;- \"hello\" \n\nThis line will block the execution of the rest of the code. \nReceivers (im_a_reciever&lt;-) always block and wait until there is data to recieve.\nOnce the receiver begins recieving data, the sender blocks (&lt;-im_a_sender):\n\nIf the channel is unbuffered, the sender blocks until a receiver has read from the channel.\nIf the channel is buffered, it will only wait until the value is copied to the buffer. If the buffer is full, it must wait until\na reciever has read from the channel and \"freed up some space\" for more data.\n\nThis is why buffered channels are considered asynchronous, because they facilitate asynchonous communication among goroutines, since the\ngoroutines don't need to consider if someone is reading what they are saying. They just go about their business.\nIf we wanted to make the channel unbuffered, we could do something like this:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n  messages := make(chan string)\n\n  go func() {\n    messages &lt;- \"hello\"\n    close(messages)\n  }()\n\n  for i := range messages {\n    fmt.Println(i)\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nWe start a goroutine that begins the message \"hello\" to our channel. Since the channel is unbuffered, it is blocked until someone reads from the channel.\nAt \"the same time\", we start a for loop the is looking at messages. It will keep trying to read from the messages channel, until it is closed.\nOnce the goroutine writes \"hello\" to messages, the for loop proceeds to give us i, which is the value in the channel, \"hello\" and we can print it with fmt.\nNow that \"hello\" was read, the goroutine can proceed to the next step of executing, closing the channel, which which also terminal the for loop and thus terminate main successfully.\nHere is an example where we don't close the channel, but it doesn't crash the program:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc add_message_to_channel(messages chan string) {\n  messages &lt;- \"hello\"\n  fmt.Println(\"woo hoo recursion\")\n  add_message_to_channel(messages)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  messages := make(chan string)\n  go add_message_to_channel(messages)\n  fmt.Println(&lt;-messages)\n}\n\n\nBecause the blocking is happening in a goroutine and not in main, the Go runtime doesn't care if the goroutine is \ndoing something and will just kill it once main is done. In theory, Go will clean up for you, but this is ugly. \nPerhaps don't do stuff like this.\nYou could use defer to close channels once a function is done with them:\n\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc add_message_to_channel(messages chan string) {\n  defer close(messages) // once we read one message from messages (causing the \n                        // function to close and return) we will never be able\n                        // to read from it again\n  messages &lt;- \"hello\"\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  messages := make(chan string)\n  go add_message_to_channel(messages)\n  for i := range messages {    \n    fmt.Println(i)\n  }\n}\n\n\nselect\nA critical keyword for working with channels is the select keyword.\nThe select keyword is like a special switch case for channels which allows you to look at multiple \nchannels at once and act of the first one to receive a value. \n\n// original: https://gobyexample.com/select\n// but I modified a bit\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  c1 := make(chan string)\n  c2 := make(chan string)\n\n  go func() {\n    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)\n    c1 &lt;- \"send this after 2 seconds\"\n  }()\n\n  go func() {\n    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)\n    c2 &lt;- \"send this after 1 second\"\n  }()\n\n  for i := 0; i &lt; 2; i++ {\n    select {\n    case msg1 := &lt;-c1:\n      fmt.Println(\"case 1:\", msg1)\n    case msg2 := &lt;-c2:\n      fmt.Println(\"case 2:\", msg2)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Output:\n// case 2: send this after 1 second\n// case 1: send this after 2 seconds\n\n\nWaitGroups\nA WaitGroup is a really simple idea but really powerful. It allows you to safely control the \nbehaviour of your goroutines in a really clean way.\nA WaitGroup is really just a fancy counter that allows you to stop you code from \nexecuting at a certain point until that counter reaches 0. \nYou instantiate a counter like this:\nvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\nAdd to it like this:\nwg.Add(1)\n\nDecrement like this:\nwg.Done()\n\nand wait like this:\nwg.Wait()\n\nUsually, WaitGroups are used combination with defer and goroutines to wait until all the goroutines\nhave finished executing. For example:\n\n// source: https://gobyexample.com/waitgroups\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"sync\"\n  \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc worker(id int) {\n  fmt.Printf(\"Worker %d starting\\n\", id)\n  time.Sleep(time.Second)\n  fmt.Printf(\"Worker %d done\\n\", id)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n  var wg sync.WaitGroup\n\n  for i := 1; i &lt;= 5; i++ {\n    wg.Add(1)\n\n    i := i\n\n    go func() {\n     defer wg.Done()\n     worker(i)\n    }()\n  }\n\n  wg.Wait()\n\n}\n\n// Output: \n// (Note that the order may change each time you run the program)\n// Worker 5 starting\n// Worker 2 starting\n// Worker 1 starting\n// Worker 3 starting\n// Worker 4 starting\n// Worker 1 done\n// Worker 3 done\n// Worker 2 done\n// Worker 5 done\n// Worker 4 done\n\n\n\n💡 Note that when you are passing a waitgroup you must do it by reference, \notherwise a new WaitGroup will be created if you try to pass by value and \nthere is no point of doing that!!\n\nContexts\nContexts are another way to synchronise the behaviours of your goroutines. \nWith contexts you can:\n\nAdd a time out, which signals to all the goroutines which have access to the context to wrap things up\nOr just manually signal to all goroutines to wrap things up by cancelling the context\n\n\n💡 Note that you need to check if the context has actually expired or been cancelled, otherwise nothing happens.\n\nThere are a few ways to to create a context: \n\nWith a deadline (a timestamp at which point the context will expire), \na timeout (a duration, which once elapsed after initialisation will cancel the context), \nor a context with a cancel function which if used will allow you to cancel the context manually when every you want. \nOr, none of these things (maybe you just need a dummy context for the moment)\n\n\n💡 You can also pass values to contexts.\n\n\n// source: https://pkg.go.dev/context#example-WithTimeout\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"context\"\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"time\"\n)\n\nconst shortDuration = 1 * time.Millisecond\n\nfunc main() {\n  // Pass a context with a timeout to tell a blocking function that it\n  // should abandon its work after the timeout elapses.\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), shortDuration)\n  defer cancel()\n\n  select {\n  case &lt;-time.After(1 * time.Second):\n    fmt.Println(\"overslept\")\n  case &lt;-ctx.Done():\n    fmt.Println(ctx.Err()) // prints \"context deadline exceeded\"\n  }\n\n}\n\n// Output:\n// context deadline exceeded\n\n\nInterfaces\n\nAccept Interfaces, Return Structs - Jim\n\nInterfaces in go are essential.\nAn interface is a collection of method signatures.\nIf a type has implemented every method in an interface, than it is said to “implement the interface”.\nTypically, you want interfaces to be small. You want them to be easy to implement.\nThe reason you might want to use an interface is that you want to use different types as\narguments to a function. \n\n// source: https://gobyexample.com/interfaces\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"math\"\n)\n\ntype geometry interface {\n    area() float64\n    perim() float64\n}\n\ntype rect struct {\n    width, height float64\n}\ntype circle struct {\n    radius float64\n}\n\nfunc (r rect) area() float64 {\n    return r.width * r.height\n}\nfunc (r rect) perim() float64 {\n    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height\n}\n\nfunc (c circle) area() float64 {\n    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius\n}\nfunc (c circle) perim() float64 {\n    return 2 * math.Pi * c.radius\n}\n\nfunc measure(g geometry) {\n    fmt.Println(g)\n    fmt.Println(g.area())\n    fmt.Println(g.perim())\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    r := rect{width: 3, height: 4}\n    c := circle{radius: 5}\n\n    measure(r)\n    measure(c)\n}\n\n\nInterfaces for testing\nInterfaces also make unit testing a lot easier.\nFor example, maybe I will have an interface call DatabaseClient like so:\ninterface DatabaseClient {\n\tReadFromDB(string) (string, error)\n\tWriteToDb(string, string) error\n}\n\nAnd then I can create two types which both implement the interface: RealDBClientand MockDBClient.\n(s *RealDBClient) ReadFromDB(str string) (string, error) {\n\t// ...\n}\n\n(s *RealDBClient) WriteToDb(str, str2 string) (error) {\n\t// ...\n}\n\n(s *MockDBClient) ReadFromDB(str string) (string, error) {\n\t// ...\n}\n\n(s *MockDBClient) WriteToDb(str, str2 string) (error) {\n\t// ...\n}\n\nNow I can thoroughly and reliably test my database client implementation.\nProject Structure\nGo projects have modules and packages.\nThis is the basic structure for a Go web app.\n.\n└── app-name\n    │\n    ├─── go.mod\n    ├─── go.sum\n    │\n    ├── main.go\n    │\n    └─── packages\n      ├── package-1\n      │   ├── handlers.go\n      │   └── handlers_test.go\n      └── package-2\n          ├── handlers.go\n          └── handlers_test.go\n\n\napp-name, whatever it is, is a module. \nTypically you would have all your server code in main.go, and everything else in /packages.\nAnother really common pattern is to use a /cmd directory of all the 'external' stuff. And /internal all your helper functions/business logic etc.\n.\n└── app-name\n    │\n    ├─── go.mod\n    ├─── go.sum\n    │\n    ├─── cmd\n    │   └── main.go\n    │\n    └─── internal\n      ├── package-1\n      │   ├── handlers.go\n      │   └── handlers_test.go\n      └── package-2\n          ├── handlers.go\n          └── handlers_test.go\n\n\nIt's okay to have files that are a thousand lines plus. Have you seen the error handling? c'mon.\nOther\ngo fmt\nGo has a formatting tool that is very helpful.\nIn your directory containing your Go code, you can run gofmt to see what the formatter would like to change.\ngofmt -s will also “simplify” your code\ngofmt -w will actually write the changes to file instead of just stdout.\ngofmt -d will display a diff to stdout.\nGo Playground\nAnother thing I recommend is using: https://go.dev/play/\nIt is a web service that will compile and run Go code, which is convenient when testing small things. \nAnd it is very easy to share code with it, so I have found it to be really useful testing and debugging alone and with other people.\nReferences\n\ngo routines (gobyexample.com/goroutines)\nchannels (Arden Labs - The behavior of channels)\nwaitgroups (gobyexample.com/waitgroups)\ndefer (gobyexample.com/defer)\ncontext (Ardan Labs - Context package semantics in go)\nbest practices and smarter explainations (Effective Go)\n\nthis doc has been froxen since January 2022, but I still like it\n\n\nGo language spec\n\nvery nice reading\n\n\n\n","id":"https://jxlxx.org/posts/go-essentials/","title":"Go Essentials"},"https://jxlxx.org/posts/soup-dumplings/":{"body":"Quantity: About ~40 dumplings, depending on how thin you roll out the dough.\nIngredients / equipment\nequipment\n\nsomething bowl like to mix the dough\nsomething like a rolling pin to roll out the dough\nsteamer (like a bamboo steamer)\nparchment/wax paper to rest the dumpling on in the steamer (or you can use something like Napa cabbage leaves) \nbig pot to cook the stock (and for steaming)\ncontainers to pour the finished broth for when it is chilling in the fridge\na ladle could be helpful, but not critical\n\ndough\n\n400g all purpose flour\n2 tsp salt\n135 ml boiling water\n135 ml room temp water\n\nbroth\nEssentials:\n\n~1.5L of vegetable stock (I strongly recommend using Better Than Bouillon)\n1 tbs agar agar\n\nFor flavour:\n\n2 tbs olive oil\n1 tbs sesame oil \n1 tsp honey (to taste)\n~1 head of garlic \n2-3 inches of ginger\n5 spicy chilis +/- to taste \nvegetarian oyster sauce (alternatively dried shitakis might be nice) \n\nfilling\n(you can use anything, this is just what I had in  my fridge)\n\n3 tbs olive oil\n1 pack of mushrooms\n1 head of bok choy\n1 pack medium form tofu\nsplash soy sauce (optional)\n\ndipping sauce\n\nblack rice vinegar\nsoy sauce\njuilliened ginger\n\nTimeline + tips\nMaking the broth jello can be relatively quick (15 mins - 1 hour, depending on what you put inside)\nbut it has to chill in the fridge for at least 4-5 hours. \nYou also prepare it in advance could leave in the fridge for a day of two.\nYou can also make the tofu/etc filling in advance.
